# c-verif-mark

This arose from discussions with people at the Isaac Newton Institute [Verified Software](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/vso2/) programme.

Looking at the various approaches and tools for verifying functional correctness of C code - especially for systems code - it's not always easy to understand their strengths and limitations.   Automated verification has obviously benefited from various competitions (see [Alastair Reid's summary](https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/).  For interactive tools comparison is harder, but it should be worthwhile to collect a modest-size set of small examples, each involving some interesting language feature and/or programming idiom, and inviting tool authors (and others) to submit model solutions for them - preferably with detailed explanations of what's going on under the hood, at least for selected examples.  In some cases it might be worth having multiple solutions, e.g. if automation means that the easiest solution isn't the most instructive, or not representative of what one would have to do in a bigger verification.

One could also collect a longer simple list of C features and idioms and ask whether (or to what extent) each tool handles them, maybe with code examples, but (to avoid making contributions overwhelming) without requiring example solutions for all those.

I'm imagining something quite lightweight, broadly along the lines of long-ago POPLmark - e.g., after collecting some agreed set of examples and questions, just having a shared github repo that tool authors could add solutions and answers to.  The aim would be simply to expose a clear comparison in this highly multidimensional space, not to have a competition (no judging, scores, or winners).

One could focus just on verifying C code as-is, or also cover the various approaches out there that verify something else and then generate C from that, or consider all verification at roughly the C level of abstraction. 

## Schedule

We'll meet Wednesday 3 August 2022, 2pm - 5pm UK time (BST=UTC+1), 3-6pm Central Europe (CEST=UTC+2), 9am-12noon East-coast USA (EDT=UTC-4), 6am-9am West-coast USA (PDT=UTC-7), 10pm-1am Seoul (KST=UTC+9), 11pm-2am Sydney (AEST=UTC+10).

In person for those in Cambridge, or by zoom with a link TBA. 

## Potential short status-update/future-plan talks

Let me know!  So far we hope for at least: 

- Andrew Appel/Lennart Beringer, VST
- Bart Jacobs, VeriFast
- Thomas Sewell, seL4 approaches
- ...more? 

- Discussion of examples

- Discussion of C feature/idiom list


## Previous comparisons 

There have been several previous comparisons over the years,  but I don't see anything that quite hits the spot. 

- [The 1st Verified Software Competition: Extended Experience Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/krml214.pdf), 2010/2011.

- [A benchmark for C program verification](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/cbench/cbench.pdf)  (cbench [repo](https://github.com/cverified/cbench/)), 2019. Marko van Eekelen, Daniil Frumin, Herman Geuvers, Léon Gondelman, Robbert Krebbers, Marc Schoolderman, Sjaak Smetsers, Freek Verbeek, Benoı̂t Viguier, Freek Wiedijk

Of these, cbench and lets-prove-leftpad are perhaps the closest, but several of those examples are rather complex, and they don't exactly target the language features and idioms that arise in systems code. . 


## Other existing sets of examples

Several tools have suites of small and large examples that have been done in that system, e.g.:

- the VST [catalog of (small and large) examples](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST/blob/master/doc/catalog-of-examples.md)
- the VeriFast [examples](https://github.com/verifast/verifast/tree/master/examples)
- the Frama-C [tutorials](https://frama-c.com/html/tutorials.html)

Then there are suites for automated-tool competitions such as SV-COMP https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/benchmarking/sv-benchmarks - far too many examples there for interactive tools, but one might pull some out, or it might be interesting to compare with the fully automated tools for simple properties.


## Candidate examples

Starting very simple, so that one can really explain what the tool is doing:

- some straight-line simple arithmetic, composing statements
- a function taking an `int *p` and returning `p+1`
- simple array update
- the `cbench` factorial examples 2.1 - 2.4
- the VST sum-of-array example
- ...



##  Candidate C feature/idiom list

Here's a fairly ad hoc list that one might improve and then use for comparison of tools.  The aim is to be discriminating while not being too long.  Some answers might need text to explain what semantics the tool assumes, not just yes/no, though it would be good to be compact enough so that the results can be presented as a (large) table.
