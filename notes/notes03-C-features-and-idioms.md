#  C features and idioms

Here's a fairly ad hoc list, off the top of my head, that one might improve and then use for comparison of tools.  The aim is to be discriminating while not being too long.  Some answers might need comments, not just yes/no - in many cases a tool might partially implement something (e.g. compound type initialisers) but not fully implement the ISO notion. However, it would be good to keep this short enough that most of the data can be presented in a single table for comparison between tools.  We should fix a format so that that table can be auto-generated from sources that can be separately edited for each tool.
