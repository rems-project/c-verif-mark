#  C features and idioms

Here's a fairly ad hoc list, off the top of my head, that one might improve and then use for comparison of tools.  The aim is to be discriminating while not being too long.  Some answers might need comments, not just yes/no - in many cases a tool might partially implement something (e.g. compound type initialisers) but not fully implement the ISO notion. However, it would be good to keep this short enough that most of the data can be presented in a single table for comparison between tools.

This needs a lightweight format so that that table can be auto-generated from sources that can be separately (and easily) edited for each tool. The questions are defined in `template.ml` and the answers should be in files like `answers_VST.ml`.  Take care not to edit the question text in the latter. For each answer, there are two strings: one that should be short and appears in the generated table, and another that appears as a template. To regenerate the markdown table, just `make` (with OCaml installed). 

The `answers_VST.ml` is my transcription of Andrew's slide - it probably needs editing. 


This `README.md` is generated by the above - don't edit it directly.
